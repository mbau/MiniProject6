MiniProject6
============

Completed Mini Project 6. Project requirements can be found here: http://www3.nd.edu/~cse/2013fa/40814/projects.html


Project Guidelines:

In the final mini project, my app develops its social skills. Integrate your app with at least one social networking site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to be able to "import" your friends and to post updates from your app on your Facebook wall or Twitter stream, etc. Note that if you use services like parse.com, they often already offer simplified social integration services and we recommend you use those!
